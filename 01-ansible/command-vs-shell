shell module will be logged in target instance and excute the command , it logged into target instance not 
secute , because permissions wise, we can do not logged into target instance , by command , like execute the 
commands from outside of the instance , which is secure 

cannot use special shell features like pipes (|), redirection (>, >>), or chaining commands (&&, ||).

- prefernce 
 1. command
 2. shell (if not work command when pipeing etc)


 why is command secure and why not shell
